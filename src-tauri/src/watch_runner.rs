//! The unattended part of "watch this session, and if it ends perfectly, shut down my laptop"
//! (doc 142, phase W5). It ties the held plan (`power_plan`), what can be seen of the agent
//! (`session_observer`, the agent's own Stop hook) and the decision (`session_verdict`) to a countdown
//! that can power the laptop off.
//!
//! The decisions are a PURE state machine (`Engine`, injected clock, no I/O) so every path, above all every
//! way of NOT shutting down, is tested. The loop around it (`run_loop`) only gathers observations and
//! carries out the engine's actions.
//!
//! What it takes to power off (all of it, at once, every time):
//!   1. the `watchPower` setting is `on` (default `off`; `dry` = practice, says it but never does it);
//!   2. a plan is held, and it is not "just tell me";
//!   3. the session ENDED (two independent signals, nothing still busy) and the verdict is Go for 15 s in a row;
//!   4. a 30 s countdown, announced aloud, then runs, and during it ANY of these stops it:
//!      "cancel" / "stop" / "wait" ..., a key or mouse movement, a meeting starting, the plan cancelled, the
//!      setting turned off, or the verdict no longer being Go. Not knowing whether the user is back also stops it;
//!   5. the normal shutdown sequence (goodbye, graceful close of apps, a last 3 s cancel window) does the rest.
